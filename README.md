############################ Spire Radar Translator #########################

# The purpose of this program is to convert the output of the Spire radar to ASTERIX format

# This archive is composed of the following files : 
# - proposedTranslator.py : This is the main program that performs the translation
# - usefulFuncTranslator.c : Contains datablock encoding functions and architecture of ASTERIX
# - usefulFuncTranslator.so : Shared librarie for both python files
# - decodingproposedTranslator.py : Used to decode a datablock into readable data


# To encode some data, just use proposedTranslator.py, modify the hardcoded data, and you'll get 
# an ASTERIX packet
